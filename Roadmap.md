# Roadmap

### Stuff that I need to implement/am thinking of implementing

Menu -> Edit (Not that urgent, as most users would probably use the keyboard shortcuts)  
(A(B)C) is currently interpreted as (A(B)(C)) (Not _really_ a bug, but not exactly wanted)  

### Stuff that I have already implemented

Syllabification  
Categories as part of other categories  
Python rules  
Decliner/Conjugator  
Get syllabification to do cats within cats (e.g. X=CV would be parsed as [CV], not [ptkbdgaeiou])  

### Stuff that would be good but I probably won't be able to implement

"What I would REALLY love is a sca that was also a dictionary program, and kept track of etymology across daughterlangs and so on." - Torco, http://www.incatena.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=36556  
Backtracking
